<p>
  Selecting universities for your Grdauate School/University is one of the most tediuos jobs to do and yet very important. University is one of those stepping stone which can certainly make your life ( &amp; vice versa). As a result, most of us tend to give extra (Quite a much) importance to this part of application (And, some of us are even obssesed with it).
  </p>
  <p>
  In fact, we are so obssesed with Universities that we don't even stop here, we go one step ahead, we will hire some shit consultant (<em>who doesn't know anything about you</em>), pay him that damn fees &amp; then we will expect him to the needful. Rather, I would suggest you to get got out of this rat race &amp; stop being obssesed with Universities. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you can't select University for your self; then sorry to say, No One can do that (<em>in the entire world </em>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So, take my advice :- </br>
  &bull; Stop being so obssessed with universities. </br>
  &bull; Don't hire any Consultant. </br>
  &bull; Don't waste months finalising your list.  </br>
  
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Frankly speaking it's very easy, you just need to keep your cool, be sensible, don't get over excited and follow some simple & basic steps.
  </p>

  <blockquote><em>As such there is no method/solution through which you can selecte universities which will accept you for sure. But there some tested tips/tricks that you can keep in your mind while makeing your list. </em></blockquote>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Money/Fees/Finances :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; There is no point going in some xyz university, if you can’t even afford its one year fees. </br>
    &bull; It’s like you going to a showroom asking for iPhone, when your budget is Rs. 15K/-. Oh, You poor thing.</br>
    &bull; So, stick to your budget (including loans and all). </br>
    &bull; Opt for those which are in your reach as far as your finances are concrened. 
  </p>

<p> 
   <strong> Your Profile:- </strong> </br>
  &bull; Selecting universities should largely depend on your profile.</br>
    &bull; Your profile will speak truth about you, what you can achieve and what you can’t.</br>
    &bull; So, analyze your profile and make a smart choice.</br>
    &bull; There is no point doing MS from CMU if you don’t even deserve to be there, because you won’t be able to cope up to other student’s standard.</br>
    &bull; So, it’s better that you accept the reality and choice what seems to be in your reach.   </br> 
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Jobs/Internships :- </strong> </br>
   &bull; Make sure, where ever you are applying your university have a very strong Alumina base, have good Job/Career Fair happening every semester and more importantly they have a very active Career Counseling Center.</br>
   &bull; Get in touch with seniors to take a on campus exprience about Job/Internship scenario.</br>
   &bull; After all you don't want to endedup in a place, where Comapnies (Jobs/Internship) comes once in a while. Pheew. :P </br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Research :- </strong> </br>
   &bull; If you are interested in pursuing Research, make sure all the university on your list caters to your future research aspirations.</br>
   &bull;See, which projects they are undertaking.</br>
   &bull; How many Research Groups/Labs they have.</br>
   &bull;How many comapnies & industries have there labs & centers on Univ. Campus. (Yes, many comapnies have labs on univ. campuses)</br>
   &bull; How much funds that university gives for Research. (This  is not so important, but you can check it if you want. Ask, some seniors, se there homepages etc.)</br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>RA/TA/PA :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; If you are an Indian, than I think there is no need to explain you the importance of Assistantship.</br>
    &bull; There is no better way to get paid for doing something than being assistant of your Prof. It comes with many added advantage.</br>
    &bull; You are paid more than those damn on campus Jobs.</br>
    &bull; You are actually doing something which will/can help in your future.</br>
    &bull; You are closely working with your Prof., what else you want.</br>
    &bull; You work on real world problems, big-big research projects.</br>
    &bull; Many Universities have some provisions where, once you are Assistant (mostly for RA) you will be entitled to pay only in-state tuition fees (Yes, I am serious) & more over you can also get some scholarship as well.</br>
    &bull; RA’s are paid throughout the year, so even if its summer or winter break you will be paid.</br>
    &bull; In short, you will always have something to support yourself in US throughout the year. Whereas on campus Jobs are usually rare to find during vacations as there will be very less no of people on campus. Hence, no work.</br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Climate :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; Many cities/states in US experiences very different climate during same time also. Thanks to its vast geographical diversity.</br>
    &bull; Climate/Weather can be very cold at some places like Minnesota and can be very hot at places like Arizona.</br>
    &bull;  You need to be very careful while picking your universities. If you have some serious issues with some sort of climate/temperature/weather, it’s always good to not go to that place. As there is nothing more important than health. You know, Health is Wealth.</br>
    &bull; Anyhow, what’s the point ending up in some University where you can’t even survive/stay? It will not help you in any way. Trust me you will ending up doing not so well in your courses.</br>
    &bull; So, make sure you make a wise choice. </br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>On Campus Jobs :- </strong> </br>
  
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Location :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; Location of a university is also a very important parameter that can be taken into account. (But, I will recommend to keep it low in your priority list)</br>
    &bull; A university in cities like New York, Texas, Boston, California and Washington is any day better than University which are in village or remote areas, as chances of getting Job/Internship increases drastically.</br>
    &bull; You have access to so many small or medium size companies in or near your area, so obviously you have an upper hand over the others.</br>
    &bull; And moreover, you can enjoy the city life. (No one ones to come US just for the sake of MS. You know what I mean. US Dreams. :D)</br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Competition :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; Ask any MS student (your seniors or anyone else) that, “Who is the biggest competitor(s) /threat(s) to an Indian Student in US?”. </br>
    &bull; And, there answer will be, “An Indian” (Yeah, that’s true). </br>
    &bull; Almost all Indians want Assistantships, Scholarships, on campus Jobs etc, but can everyone can get it? </br>
    &bull; Obviously. NO. University cannot support each and every Indian student. </br>
    &bull; So, that means less opportunity and more competition (and that too from our beloved brothers & sisters). All credit goes to us such beautiful Indians. </br>
    &bull; And, the situation is made worse by our brothers from the neighboring country. Yes, you got it right, Chinese. Even they are not very different from us, they also face all those issues about funding and all that we Indian face. </br>
    &bull; And, trust me Chinese people are better than us. </br>
    &bull; So, know you should be clear about the competition scene in US, esp. among Indians & Chinese people. </br>
    &bull; So, it’s always a good choice to get into some University which has less no of Indians & Chinese population. (And, trust me you won’t get many, except some. Try your luck.) </br>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   <strong>Alumina Base :- </strong> </br>
    &bull; Unlike India (expect IIT, IIM & NITs), Univ. in US have a strong Alumina base. These Alumina plays a very substantial role in colleges day to day activities. </br>
    &bull; They give lot of donations to college for the betterment of college and students, they bring companies to their Alma matter, in US you can easily finds Alumina’s being very active in college/university matters even after they leave the college. </br>
    &bull; Stronger Alumina base directly signifies the strength of Univ. or college. </br> 
    &bull; Being in touch with aluminas is a great way of networking & bonding with people who are working in industry, you never know you can land your first internship/job because of their reference or recommendations. </br>
   
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   These factors are more than enough to come to some constructive conclusion, and most probably you will be able to make a list which will align with your profile as well as interset. 
   </br>
   But, having said that, it can vary from person to person depending on personla choices and many other factors.
   
  </p>
   So, try to use these points in which ever way you want to, but make sure once your list is ready, try to check on how many parameters/factors can it withstand. 
   </br>
   You will automatically get the answer, whethe your list is realistic or not.
