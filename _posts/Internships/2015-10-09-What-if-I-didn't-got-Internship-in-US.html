By internship, i assume that you also mean fellowship, scholorship and other Financial aids.
Not getting any one of the above means having excessive economic burden to an Indian student studying in USA. Students start doing part time jobs in order to help their lunches, travel costs, accomodations, etc.
But a student visa only allows 20 hours/week of job permission to a foreign student.
Generally students make most of this policy and work for 15-20 hours per week as a part time employee in cafeterias, hotels, libraries, stores etc.
Savings is one more prevalent practice. They live a limited and very optimized life to reduce the spendings.
Take food once in a day and adjust the rest of the day with some light snacks. Again, it is done to save or cut down the spendings.
They think a lot before travelling and only do so whenever it is required genuinely. Same applies for the case of coming back home in vacations, they prefer earning there during vacation time instead of flying back home- Again money is the only factor.
It is tough, but an experience worth experiencing. Those two years of adjustments and hard work are seriously tough for foreign students.
