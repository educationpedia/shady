What is a Co-op Program?

A co-op program incorporates paid professional career training into a typical degree. Students alternate their time in the classroom with significant time (e.g. three semesters) in a real workforce setting. In addition to earning an hourly wage for their work, many participants receive academic credit or a transcript notation when they have successfully completed their co-op program.

Co-ops are focused on training students for a career in their chosen major (e.g. IT, engineering, etc.). To that end, universities often partner with employers in government, industry, business, non-profits and more. Depending on the co-op job, students may end up working across the country or even overseas. However, each participant is usually supervised by a professional who has followed the same career path.

The overall goal of a co-op is to give students combinations of theory + practice and knowledge + experience. Participants go through a continuous cycle of learning, applying and reflecting on their education while they earn money to pay for college.



What’s Cool About Co-Op Programs?
Money

Unlike a generic part-time job or unpaid internship, a co-op program combines an hourly wage with solid job experience in your field. Depending on your major, you might be able to earn enough to cover your tuition costs.

    According to the NACE 2014 Internship & Co-op Survey, the average hourly wage for co-ops was $17.44 at the bachelor’s level and $25.04 at the master’s level. That’s not too shabby at 40 hours a week for six months.
    According to a Forbes 2012 article, co-op participants can earn up to $46,000 at Drexel University, Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Cincinnati (i.e. around $15,000 per semester).
    56.8% of employers made full-time offers to their co-op students (NACE 2014 Internship & Co-op Survey)
    After one year, almost 60% of co-op students who accepted a full-time job with their employer were still there (NACE 2014 Internship & Co-op Survey)
    Here’s the really good news. As of 2015, co-op earnings are not counted against a student’s eligibility for federal need-based aid. In other words, co-op earnings will not increase your estimated family contribution (EFC). For more detailed information, see our Tips on FAFSA and Troy Onink’s 2012 article in Forbes: Why College Co-Op Programs Totally Rock. In addition, if you provide more than 1/2 of the support (i.e. your annualized cost of college) from your earned income (i.e. co-op pay) only, you can avoid the dreaded “kiddie tax” (having to pay your parent’s higher tax rate on your own earnings during college).

Hands-On Learning

Paper pushing is not part of the deal! In a strong co-op program, employers work closely with universities to ensure each job is tied to specific learning outcomes. That means you’ll be able to:

    Tackle real projects and work responsibilities
    Link classroom theory to actual practice
    Experiment with cutting edge equipment and technologies
    Deepen your 21st century vocational and technical skills
    Have an insider’s access to new industry developments

Career Opportunities

A classroom is no substitute for on-the-ground experience. Co-ops can help you:

    Explore career goals and sharpen career objectives
    Receive a solid job offer from your co-op employer (~60% of co-op participants do)
    Begin at a higher starting salary and level of responsibility
    Advance faster up the career ladder
    Impress graduate school committees with your practical knowledge
    Acquire valuable leadership, communication and collaboration skills
    Network with professional mentors and valuable contacts
