Make plans way before (like seriously WAY BEFORE) you need the intern/job.
That involves:

1. Know what kind of job you want. No point being vague, it's always appreciated that you have done your research on the company and are also clear about your goals.

2. Have some (at least 6-8) target companies which do the kind of work you want to try your hands on.

3. Use social media/google to gather information about current employees in that company with similar backgrounds and on similar roles. This will involve what kind of projects/skill sets they possess.

4. Groom/ Tailor your resume according to the requirement. Because you start early, now you have a good chance of acquiring new skills that might just get you the job.

5. Figure out if you can be a part of a project at school/on your own which might be of interest to them. (usually it involves using tools that they use or on a hot topic which the company is focused on)

6. Learn to speak up (make conversations with random people) - improving/having kickass people skills will take you a long way. This will come in handy especially during phone/f2f interviews.

7. And the last and the MOST IMPORTANT: Make useful contacts, go to conferences, career fairs, meet ups (there are plenty happening around you, and you don't need an introduction, just show up), talk to alumni, professors - basically anyone who you think might be able to get a good word on your behalf. This will often prove invaluable later during the actual job hunt. One good word can open doors for you like no other. :)

Happy hunting.
