Everyone’s familiar with internships, right?  They’re pretty straightforward, typically available for college students (traditionally rising juniors or seniors) and give a person an inside look into a company.  Gone are the days of the interns serving as the company “go-for”, getting coffee all summer, and picking up the boss’ dry-cleaning.  Today, internships are much more.  As an intern, a person may have the opportunity to work as part of a team, providing value to the overall organization as they’re included in the creative process.  Some interns may even be mentored by executives and have the opportunity to present to a group of their peers or senior-level individuals on the outcomes of their special projects. 

But, what’s the difference between an internship and a co-op opportunity?  Why should job seekers consider both?  I get this question a lot, so I thought I would share with you some of the key differentials between the two.  Each provides a unique perspective – if you have the chance to do both, go for it!

Internships

    Usually a one-time work (10-12 week) assignment, often in the summer
    Typically doesn’t interfere with college classes due to timing, but less training is given because of this
    Can be full- or part-time, paid or unpaid, depending on the employer and the career field
    Undergraduate students (rising Junior/Senior) are eligible in most cases.  It’s rare to find internships available at larger companies for freshmen and graduating seniors
    You don’t have to miss a semester or two to complete an internship
    You’ll have an edge over students who don’t have experiential education gained through an internship
    Internships are usually limited to one area of responsibility (marketing, human resources, IT, etc.)
    Average GPA sought is 3.0, with 3.5 in some cases

Co-Ops

    Co-ops are a joint venture between the university, a selected employer, and you
    Traditionally at least three work terms alternated with school terms, resulting in a 5-year degree program (it’s going to take longer to graduate, but you’ll have some good experience)
    Co-Ops are full-time, paid positions
    More training is offered through a Co-Op
    Some Co-Ops are rotational, offering opportunities across functions
    Graduate students are eligible in most cases for Co-Ops
    Students frequently start at higher salaries and higher levels of responsibility than interns
