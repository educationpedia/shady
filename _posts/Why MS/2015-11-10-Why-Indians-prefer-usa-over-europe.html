<p>
As of now not only Indian's but almost every other students from evry other country choose to go US over European contries. </br>
</p>
<p>
There is no doubt that US is way aheaa of others, but latter is no where behind from US. Many countries in Europe have also realised that they have to be bit more democratic when it comes to International Students. </br>
</p>
<p>
As it can boost there economy or at least can play an important role in Countries trembling economy.( Indians spends $ 13 Billions every year on Education in US (Read <a href="http://profit.ndtv.com/budget/indians-spend-rs-45-000-crore-per-year-on-foreign-education-study-745514">this</a> & it's growing every year, every country wants to tap this much amount).
</p>

<p>
But, still US is the most sought after option across the World (and will remain for next 4-5 Years). And, the reasons are--
</p>  

<p><strong>Economic Reasons</strong> </br>
<strong>1.) Sagging economy</strong></br>
For quite some time , European union has been doing not-so-good on economic front. Euro plunging down and so are the currencies pegged with it. Firing on jobs are becoming commonplace in some countries and South is registering a double digit unemployment rate.</br>
</p>

<p><strong>2. Currency rates (follow from 1)</strong></br>
A year ago , a Danish krone fetched you 11 Rs. Now it is getting you around 9 Rs. Even though the wages are high here , my friends are shell shocked when they realize that they are incurring a difference of 2-2.5 Rs. on every krone sent to India
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>3. High(er) income in USA</strong></br>
I am quite surprised to find that my friends in USA are earning quite a lot of money in USA. And to rub salts on our wounds, the taxes are quite high here and so is the cost of living (and with 25% extra VAT)
</p>
  
<p>  
<strong>4. Saving potential (follows from 3)</strong></br>
All Indians whom I meet or talk will always , without failing ask this questions 15 minutes into the conversation. While I don't save*, I should tell that if you have a lesser income but higher expenses, this would imply that your savings are going to be even lesser. So if you are raking in enough of forex with the sole intent of converting to INR and buy a property in future, you might be disappointed.
* To know how much you typically save as a graduate in Europe (Denmark) here's my answer. Compare it with other answers (For USA) and see the difference for yourselves. How much do NRI single graduates save every year?
</p> 

<p>
<strong>Cultural reasons</strong></br>
<strong>5. Language barriers</strong></br>
Though an average Indian knows 2 Indian language and Queen's language through school, (s)he might hesitate to learn a new language from scratch. And by learning I am not implying the touristy level, but the cold blue native one which would be required to get jobs and mingle in the social circle with the natives. And you have to do this while managing full time studies (if you have chosen this path). USA has no such issue. Language learning suck a part of your opportunity time which could have been utilized in improving on your job related skills and academics. But on a brighter note, you get skilled in a different language and have better insight into the lokal culture.
Language issues also implies that there are not so many English medium courses offered by universities and thus you are restricted in your selection.
</p>
<strong>6. Interaction with lokals (follows from 5)</strong></br>
Even if you manage to find a job without language issue, getting in a social setting could be tricky. Many a times, you might feel left out and would find the whole thing drab. This partly explains why so many Indians tend to remain together in a group, at least in Europe.
</p>

<p>
<strong>7. Fear of unknown</strong></br>
This is an important factor. Indians are. by an large, risk aversive species and even if they are venturing outside, they wish to ensure that everything is same (or nearly replicated) as the things back home. Nothing wrong in it, it just sound comical. Given no language issues, and our ties with Anglosphere resulted in significantly sustained immigration to these countries, USA in particular. With a sizeable minority, Indians would be gravitated to places who have many of their kind, this will offer a seamless and easy getting on board process in that country. This leads to an institutionalized 'herd mentality' whereby juniors follow their senior batchmates or their peers. A generation later this is established as an acceptable culture.
Europe , OTOH, is quite diverse. An Indian living in London, will have large difference in experience from the one staying in, say Stuttgart, Oslo ,Sofia or even Kyiv. With not so much historical immigration (except UK and now maybe, Germany), Indians are not as ease here and turn to whatever few 3-4 Indians they might have in the vicinity. It it also to be observed that point 6, and 7 form a self perpetual cycle and is at best, leads to lack of lokal experience, and at worst, leads to developing ghettos. This has far reaching ramifications (See administrative reasons)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Administrative reasons</strong></br>
<strong>8. Visa policies</strong></br>
EU, at the moment requires large number of young people in their workforce to fund welfare policies of several states and mitigate the loss of workers due to fast ageing population. But their immigration and visa policies reflect otherwise. Take , for instance UK who in 2012 shelved off the Post study work visa and significantly cut the number of hours a non-EU student might work; And return after you are done studying in their crappy universities. Who would from a poor country, in a right frame of mind ,go to such countries to study only to return with loans of 10+ lakh rupees? EU must understand that student coming from non-western countries are not coming for studies and getting degrees, but becoming an economic migrant. In hindsight, they are just choosing a long drawn out plan as compared to a lowly refugee or asylum seeker. USA too have some draconian issues like these (H1B and others) but not as depressing as that of EU. Though USA has that typical requirement of proving strong ties back home and willing to return afterwards, I guess it is simply a formality.
</p>

<p>
<strong>9. Employment</strong></br>
Following from 8, there's an unwritten rule in industry that is when it comes to employment, the order of preference is Lokal person (native) > Lokal person* > other EU member > other non-EU Western person > non-EU non-Western.
Indians represent the last rung of the hierarchy and thus might miss several opportunities which they might have in their course of stay. This could be quite frustrating at times.
* Lokal person is someone like me who has been living here for a while, like as a student. Until some time ago, this was not the option but things seem to get better now.
</p>

<p>
<strong>10. Immigration</strong></br>
EU members might have fissiparous tendencies but at the end of the day this is something which a Londoner, Stockholmer, Bucurestean and Roman can agree upon. The immigration debate is picking up steam in several member countries and immigration (especially from non-western countries) is now being considered failed in Europe. If anything to go by, the 2014 EU parliament elections testify it where several far right parties won large vote share. There's however a gamut of misunderstanding from both the sides, I believe. Unfortunately, as an immigrant, the Charlie's killing and Copenhagen shooting doesn't help my case. The laws regarding long term residence, family reunification and citizenship are quite restrictive and woefully difficult. USA is also not easy, but not as difficult (Please correct me here  in case if I am wrong as I don't know much about USA).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong></br>
<strong>11. Racism</strong></br>
This is a favorite pet peeve for Indians and for quite a while this card had been played so many times that the exact word has lost it's importance. Having said it, I won't toe the PC line of politicians and at the outset say that there is strong undercurrent of paranoia (not racism) in European closed circles against immigrant (again non-western ones). Call it the ills of ghettoisation, Immigrants and natives don't seem to know much about each other and keep their knowledge restricted to popular stereotypes (which are also not all true).
I however feel that there is more racism (and not paranoia) in USA as I expect USA (which had seen so many immigrants) to be better accustomed to seeing different people. Which is unfortunately not the case. (But as I have not lived in USA I can't claim correctly so correct me if I am wrong)
</p>

<p>
<strong>12. Geopolitics</strong></br>
Any war in middle east or unrest in North africa would sent in endless stream of refugees to Europe. The problems are initiated by uncle sam (who is sitting far away) and Europe bears the brunt. Any issue with Russia (these days on Crimea and Denmark missiles)  would see next day energy prices rising in mainland or exports taking a downhike. Bad feelings, relative closeness to troubling areas and direct impact of these geopolitical issues on EU's economy means that EU as of now, is not so stable compared to USA. To add to misery, the PIIGS members have lot to sort amongst themselves with Greece giving signals of leavin EU every now and then. The stability has significant impact on economy, jobs, currency and related issues.
