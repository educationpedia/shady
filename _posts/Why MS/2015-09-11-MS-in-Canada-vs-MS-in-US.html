There are a lot of factors that might weigh in your decision to pursue your Masters Degree either in The US or Canada.

Okay, So lets get down to the Pros and Cons List

    School Selection - Both US and Canada have World class Universities as well as not so good Universities. If we leave aside the top 7-8 US universities (MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Caltech, Stanford etc) then the top Canadian universities (McGill, U of Toronto, UBC) as very comparable to the other reputed universities in the US. Therefore, if you can get an admit into the the top 7-8(or say 10) schools in the US then you should probably go there, otherwise, you should consider these schools also.

    Again, US has a larger number of Universities, especially the mid-ranked ones so you might have more choices for the mid-ranked Universities. Whereas, I believe that the low-ranked universities in US are way shittier than the ones in Canada (No Name calling here). Canada, being egalitarian, does not tend to have many poor universities.
    The Cost Factor - Canadian Universities simply blow the US ones out of the water. Higher Education in Canada is way cheaper than US. Leave aside U of Toronto (which is still cheaper than many US universities), rest of the Universities (McGill, UBC, U of Alberta, U of Waterloo etc) will cost you almost half as much the US counterparts. So, you can basically get similar education with less debt.
    Weather - This is one of the parts where Canada can really suck on. Let me tell you one thing, if you can't bear Winters, then you should probably never think of living in Canada. Winters in most parts(except Vancouver,BC) can get terribly cold. You should expect something like -20 degree Celsius with 2-3 feet of snow in winters. Whereas, The US has areas which can be as cold as Canada(in Winters) and as hot as India (in summers), and then, there are places like California, Florida etc.(Pure Paradise)
    Overall, you have more options of choosing better weather in US than Canada.
    Job Opportunities - Definitely, US has more Job opportunities and internships than Canada, but, it also has a larger applicant pool, more international students than Canada. So, it is like comparing a more crowded place with larger number of jobs to a lesser crowded place with less jobs. The pay, however, might be slightly higher for US people. Again, you can study in Canada and work in US. Many US companies hire from Canadian schools, however, this number would be negligible while comparing it to US schools.

    Overall, the ratio of Jobs to People in Canada is almost similar to US and the difference in pay is not high ( say $5000-7000 per year) and you still have a chance to work in US, rather, anywhere in the world.
    Work Permit hassle - Canada trumps over US in this scenario. Canada provides a minimum work permit for the length of the study program(2 yrs for masters), up to a maximum of three years according to the PGWPP (Post Graduation Work Permit Program). So, after the completion of your masters you will get a minimum of 2 years to a maximum of 3 years of work permit (most people get 3 yrs), which, again, can be extended by your employer. Moreover, most of the people get their PR (Permanent Residence Status) within this period.

    While in US you will have to face tough luck for H1B. You will first have to get an employer to sponsor you an H1B, then play the lottery. A total of  about 85,000 H1B will be issued in 2015, out of which, only 20,000 will be reserved for the Masters/PhD students. And since the number of international applicants going to the US are increasing day by day, the chances of getting through this lottery will decrease.
    So, you basically will have three options if you do not have your H1B after the completion of your OPT/CPT.
    1) Go for PhD, enroll in a school again. 2) Marry a US citizen and become one. 3) Come back to your native country and pay your hefty loan from there.
    Taxes - Well Canada has higher taxes than US, much because of the Free Healthcare which is provided to every citizen of Canada. So, yes you will be paying more taxes in Canada but you will not have to buy expensive insurance (like most people do in US).
    Immigrant Friendly - Well, everyone will have different views about this, but, personally i feel that Canada is more immigrant friendly than most of the other countries of the world, mostly because, most of the people living there were once immigrants themselves. Again, people might have different views about this.

    Overall, I am not saying that MS in Canada is better or worse than US.
    Both have their own advantages and disadvantages and you should set your preferences accordingly.

    Personally, I find MS in Canada to be a safer bet.
