  More than 3 Lakhs Indian go abroad anually for there Higher studeis (I am serious, read <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-08-28/wealth/65969493_1_north-india-credila-students">this</a>) &amp; of which most of them opt US as there destination. 
</p>
  
<p> <strong>
  So, </br>
 1.) What make US so special..? </br>
 2.) What do they do, that others can't do ? </br>
 3.) Why US is the most sought after destination for Higher Studeis (or even studies) ? </br>
 4.) Why MS in US?

  Well, answer to all the above question is almost very similar. US does lot of things which others are not able to do (even if they are doing it, they are not as effecint as US). And, some of these things are these :-
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Reputation/ Standard of University :-  </strong> </br>
 1.) No one can beat when it comes to standard or reputation of US University. They are the best.</br>
 2.) More than 50% of Universities in top 100 Universities of the World are from US itself. Go through this <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25">link</a>. </br>
 3.) US universities have produced the largest number of Nobel Laureates. Yeah, till date thay have given 344 Nobel Laureates to the World (<a href="http://mic.com/articles/67109/which-country-has-won-the-most-nobel-prizes-check-this-map#.czmDKuFSU">link</a>). Second is UK, which have given just 119. See the difference.</br>
</p>  


<p>
 <strong>Quality of Education :-  </strong></br>
 1.) Quality of Education in US of top notch. No one can beat them. </br>
 2.) Education is US is about learning. </br>
     - About preparing children to explore and understand concepts. </br>
     - Is about learning the concept not just by reading but by actually learning through practicals. </br>
     - Is not about stressing kids on exams. </br>
     - Is not about academic competitiveness. </br>
     - Is about learning in small numbers. </br>
     - One can excel in many ways not just academically but also through sports. </br>
     - You will be given support for every thing at almost every level. </br>
     - This is not the case with India at least.</br>
 3.) That's why they have produced so many Nobel Laureates, Academician, Prof.. (check my fav. <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/department/faculty/M/Onur_Mutlu_4195.html">Prof. Onur Mutlu</a>).

<p>
 <strong>Job Opportunities :-  </strong></br>
 1.) US is Mecca for CS and Electrical people.</br>
</p>


<p>
 <strong>Research :-  </strong></br>
 1.) They are pioneer in Research. </br>
 2.) Almost all the big invention & discoveries have come fromt his country only (except seome from European Countries). (Read <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things_that_mit_made">this</a>).</br>
 3.) They invest more than 5% of there GDP in Research, whose results are very evident.</br>
 4.) Best place to do Research.</br>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Ease of Law :-  </strong></br>
 1.) They have quite a simple frame work for International Students to come &amp; pursue ther education &amp; dreams in States. (at least simpler than other countries, esp. European)</br>
 2.) They support International Students throughout there stay in States throug variuos means.</br>
 3.) They also give opportunities to people to work in US for some years. (which is not very likely with countries)</br>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Culture :-  </strong></br>
 1.) US is no more an unknown place. You can easily find large Indian Community base.</br>
 2.) Almost all univeristy have Assocations of Indian Students who help new students with every possible things, they also organise Indian culture events/festivals. </br>
