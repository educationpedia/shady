I imagine that for many people from overseas, if they want to work in the US, they believe that having a US degree will help them, because it's a "known entity". For others, they may want to study in a niche that's not covered by the Australian market (though that would be unusual; most Masters' programs aren't that specialised and Australia has hundreds of Masters' programs.) I imagine the primary reason is due to the US' cultural dominance, and it not occurring to many students that there are alternatives to a US degree.

Australia has some extremely high quality universities, including 5 in the global top 100 (Rankings of Australian Universities 2014-2015). Foreign students do flock here to study in significant numbers, particularly from South-East Asia (China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore), India, and the Middle East, and in smaller numbers from Africa, South America, the US, and Europe.

Education is a significant export for Australia, both in undergraduate and graduate degrees. Many foreign students do come here to study because Australian degrees are recognised as being of high quality.

Our national trade body, Austrade, devotes significant resources to promoting Australian education overseas: Education - Home - Information for the Australian international education sector - Austrade

Given the choice between a USA MS or and Australian MS, I think the only wise decision would be the USA because the return on investment is higher.  An Australian MS is going to cost you at least AU$20,000 a year in fees as an international student.    Did I mention that was the cheapest?  Master of Information Technology, Monash University is AU$33,000 a year. Page on anu.edu.au  is ANU and that will run you AU$37,000 a year in fees.

The cost of living is pretty high in Australia.  You're looking in cheaper places at rent at AU$200 a week, but probably closer to AU$350-$450 if you want a place to yourself as an adult student.  This doesn't even consider higher costs of living than the USA for the necessities.  The advice I got was you should really calculate that you need at least $18,000 a year for the cost of living on top of your fees.  This puts a cheaper program at around AU$37,000 a year and one of the internationally ranked ones at about AU$51,000 a year.

Maybe that money isn't bad, but your funding chances are pretty close to nil.  Australia, led by the Abbott government and basic on historical precedence, pretty much has a policy that international students are cash cows.  Moo moo.  Universities have a financial incentive to take your money to offset the costs of their domestic students.  You really, really, really need to self fund because they are not going to give you money unless there are some exceptional circumstances.  (And you're only likely to get them going in if you're applying for a program that was listed like a job application, where funding is promised at the onset.)  At times, as an international student, you can really, really, really feel this.  I remember going to some meeting or other and the university people pretty much said this to people, though it wasn't 100% directly said.  Australian universities want your money and you are a commodity.

Now, the high cost of attendance, the lack of funding and being treated like a cash cow if you're an international wouldn't be so bad if the quality of education and international prestige were there. University Rankings lists the University of Melbourne, ANU, University of Sydney, University of Queensland in the top 50.  In the 50 - 100 range, you have Monash University, QUT, and University of Adelaide.  On the whole though, the quality of Australian universities has been going down internationally.  The USA has six universities in the top ten and seven in the top twenty.  Australia has two.  (Germany has zero.  The UK has four.  Canada has one.  Hong Kong has three.)  There are more options to apply to on the USA side than the Australian side.  And the Australian ones aren't at the very top.  They have less recognition outside their home country, and are mostly designed to help get jobs in the Australian economy, or send you back to your home country after your economic value to them has run out because you've graduated.

In any case, Australian universities appear to me to be on a downward trend reputationally because of a variety of factors. Australia's top universities lose ground in latest world rankings is from 2013. Australian universities climb Times world rankings, while US and UK lose ground and Australian universities slip in global reputation rankings are from 2014 and the things behind the scenes look bad.  (My own Australian university is an example of that.  The USA actually removed it from their lists of educational institutions where USA students are eligible to get loans to subsidize their funding to attend.)  Long term, the international value is going to slip as... well... back to that cash cow thing where education becomes less about quality research and more about making the most money from their students.

While the economic situation was favorable in 2010, the current Abbott led government is not doing a really good driving the economic ship.  Page on oecd.org has details on the economic outlook, and it isn't a great picture.  I wouldn't bet the bank on being able to get a job post graduation (because visa wise, you'd need probably $2,500 to apply) and the need to move would also result in a fair amount of fees.  ZOMG the moving. :(

If someone asked me which country they should get a degree from, I would recommend the USA over Australia based on all of that.  I can't find the ROI to spend that much on an Aussie MS.  If some one could make a good argument that an Aussie MS is worth AU$100,000, please show me the data.



I cannot speak for Germany much.  In abstract, I would say there are a few points in favor of Germany: It is cheaper and you can get contacts inside Germany for potential employment post graduation.  There are a few downsides including language, and the programs on the whole being lower ranked and having less international prestige than the USA.
